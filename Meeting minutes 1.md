- Zihao has a strong computing background, enjoys coding in python and Java
- Xiaohan has a strong statistics background, fluent in R and statistics
- Kesh has a strong data science background, enjoys computational linguistics and machine learning
- Our strengths seem to compliment each other and we seem to have a very balanced skillset.
- Open to most projects and a strong willingness to learn fields and domains that they might not have any background knowledge in

2) Looked through the project list and decided top 5 projects in preparation for bidding.

3) Settled on notion and git as our collaborative software of choice as we planned to take down notes of every meeting (as its an added requirement for marking)

4) Worked out a rough plan for the upcoming weeks on how we approach the project as well pooled together our timetables so that we can fix a weekly hour to dedicate to team meetings.
