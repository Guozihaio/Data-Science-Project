**Item: Summary and discussion of different research articles**

**Allocated time: 40 minutes**

**Notes:**

**Kesh:** Clinical Guidelines for Organ Transplantation(Liver) from Deceased Donor

- What exactly is Liver transplant and how it is currently working
- Liver allocation & Emerging issues

We do not need to deal with the situation that the patient is an adult or a cancer patient etc

There are some MELD extensions can be considered alternative options like MELD Na

We have HepC data

**CiCi:**  A Clinically Based Discrete-Event Simulation of End-Stage Liver Disease and the Organ Allocation Process

- Introduction of DES
- Introduction five modules of the model
- The method of validating the model

The details of the screening process before calculating the posttransplant  survival rate?

Under what condition put the patients into the list again?

How to handle the survial rate? just take an existing model or we look at beyond that?

**Xiaohan:** Simulating the Allocation of Organs for Transplantation

- The U.S organ allocation system
- The method of simulation model
- Explanation of elements of this model

What is the organ acceptance? Is it related to donor and patient matching?

**Sophia:** Evidence-Based development of liver allocation:a review

- MELD
- Benefit

transplant benefit based on location is an option but it is not neccessarily superior

**Zihao:** LivSim:An open-Source Simulation Software Platform for Community Research and Development for Liver Allocation Policies

Zihao records it

**Item: Next Steps**

**Allocated time: 10 minutes**

**Notes:**

- survival is the key -- look at basic survival analysis models in particular
- run the code
- write the background information(reasonable amount on liver transplant and the sort of issues to do with transplant as well as different allocation system) and what we like to do etc
- read Eunice's paper and summarize
