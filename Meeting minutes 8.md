- Research questions
- The main question is, what is it that we are really doing
- change methodology
- description of the table dataset
- Structure separate methods and results, don't need to talk about every test and methods
- need separate section to talk about the discussion of the results (what does actually mean) with regards to the research method
- compare discussion to the literature review and talk about what to do in

Intro

- more problem description, research question,s etc

Lit review

- good
- add more lit reviews from the first sem

Rename into Data (chapter 3)

Join method for classification/regression

Make a new chapter for only Results

Discussions, discussion results in further

Conclusions

*Kmeans results plotted but never discussed (talk about mean of each cluster etc)

- basically, when there is a result/plot, we have to summarised and discuss it a little

Motivate why we are doing our analysis (KMeans etc) in the methodology (why we choose to do this)

<Visualisation>

- discuss
- lost in between methodology & results
